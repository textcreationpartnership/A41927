            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>THE true Account of <hi>Lochzels,</hi> the chief of the Rebels Clans death, is, that the Rebels having reſolved to ſend ſome conſiderable Men of their Number to the late King <hi>James,</hi> to ſignifie the Condition they were in, and to ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quaint him that they could not be able to hold out a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt the powerful Army that was coming againſt them; and Sir <hi>John Drummond</hi> of <hi>Machany</hi> having ſaid to <hi>Midenald</hi> of <hi>Glengary, That they that were King</hi> James<hi>'s Proſelytes were his Enemies: Glengary</hi> ſaid, <hi>That he was <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 word">

                  </gap> Rogue, and that he was as good a Proteſtant as he was:</hi> upon which they both drew, <hi>Lochzel</hi> came to ſeparate them, and in the doing of it got his deadly wound.</p>
            <p>Letters came here yeſterday from the North, bringing Confirmation of Sir <hi>Thomas Levingſtone</hi> and Major <hi>Mackay</hi>'s Conduct, who led on the Party at <hi>Crundale;</hi> and add, that <hi>Ruthan</hi> and <hi>Cannon</hi> having ſled diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent ways in the time of the Action, they are in purſuit of <hi>Cannon</hi>'s Party that ſled with him, of which, and the former, you may have a fuller Account by our next.</p>
            <p>Lieutenant <hi>George Murray</hi> who was taken Priſoner at <hi>Pearth</hi> this day Twelve-month by the Lord <hi>Dundee,</hi> and has been Priſoner ſince for the moſt part in the <hi>Iſle of Mull,</hi> being exchanged, as was ſaid, formerly with Captain <hi>Dunbar,</hi> arrived here on <hi>Tueſday</hi> Night, and gives an Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count that he received none of the Money his Lady ſent to him, the Carrier being plundered thereof by the Rebels, but was in a ſtarving Condition, as appears by the Figure he makes at preſent. But he gives this Incouragement to all honeſt men here, that the Rebels there are in a great Conſternation, fearing they ſhall have no Relief from <hi>Ireland;</hi> and that he doubts not but the Common People will yield at the firſt Approach of any of the King's Forces.</p>
            <pb facs="tcp:43535:2"/>
            <p>Laſt Night we had the following Letter by the Poſt from <hi>Ireland.</hi> The Tenor follows:</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Lisborn</hi> 23 <hi>April,</hi> 1690. The Nineteenth Inſtant Colonel <hi>Guſtavus Hamilton</hi> went from his Gariſon at <hi>Clunſh,</hi> with a ſmall Party, twelve Miles into the Enemies Quarters, and brought off Two hundred Cows, Four hundred Sheep, and a great many Horſes; and though he paſt near ſeveral of their Gariſons, met with no Oppoſition, but came ſafe home. Then followed the Account of Sir <hi>Cloudſley Shovels</hi> Action which you have heard. The <hi>22d</hi> Inſtant a Party of Four hundred <hi>Iriſh</hi> got ſafe into <hi>Charlemont,</hi> but we do not hear they have carried in any Proviſions more then upon their backs. This Recruit is not much valued by our Great Ones here, who ſay that great numbers of men is not mainly material to the Defence of that Place.</p>
            <p>The late King has permitted ſeveral Women of Quality to come from <hi>Dublin</hi> lately, who ſay that the <hi>French</hi> and <hi>Iriſh</hi> Factions claſh mightily, and that King <hi>James</hi> conceiving the latter to be the beſt ſupport he has at preſent, complies with and favours them moſt. <hi>Tyrconnel</hi> and the <hi>French</hi> generally Jarr-extreamly, but the former and his Cabal bear the ſway in all Conſultations.</p>
            <p>Since writing of this, I ſpoke juſt now with a man that came from <hi>Ardmagh</hi> yeſterday morning, who ſays, Yeſterday by break of day Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jor <hi>Oregan</hi> came from <hi>Charlemont</hi> with Five hundred Men, intending to ſurprize a ſmall Fort which we have on the <hi>Black water</hi> near <hi>Benbburb,</hi> and Twelve Miles only from <hi>Charlemont:</hi> The Ford was kept by one Captain <hi>Moor,</hi> with a Detachment of One hundred of the <hi>Derry</hi> men; he being Alarmd by his out Centinels, who were beaten in, preſently put his Men in Order, and marched out and encountred the Enemy fair<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly in the Field, who were divided in three Batalians, the one drawn up before another; he Attack'd the firſt, and put them to the Rout very ſuddenly, ſo as they all ran for it; <hi>Oregan</hi> and moſt of them fled to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>words <hi>Crawfield,</hi> and ſome towards <hi>Loghgall,</hi> where ſome of Col. <hi>Dun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comb</hi>'s French lye, who came out and knock'd them down, and brought in thirteen Priſoners; and when he came away about Nine a Clock, he ſays, all the Country was purſuing them with Huy and Cry, but how many were killed he could not learn: he ſays of our men were killed twelve or thirteen, and ſeveral wounded.</p>
